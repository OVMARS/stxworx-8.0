# STXWORX Task Backlog

## Product direction inferred from the codebase

The codebase and markdowns point to this as the intended product direction:

- A Stacks-based freelance marketplace with on-chain escrow for project funding and milestone payments.
- An off-chain coordination layer for auth, profiles, projects, proposals, milestones, disputes, reviews, settings, notifications, messaging, social posts, bounties, and admin tools.
- A reputation and identity layer built around profile quality, social presence, admin moderation, and NFT / soulbound badge concepts.
- AI used as a support/proposal-assistance feature, not as the core payment or protocol layer.

## Explicit product decision

- Keep a single escrow-first marketplace journey across backend, client, contracts, and documentation.
- Remove deprecated alternate payment concepts that conflict with proposal acceptance and escrow activation.
- Prefer one authoritative activation path: accept proposal, verify the escrow transaction, activate the project.

## Key audit findings

- The strongest implemented direction is still the escrow marketplace plus admin/social/reputation layers.
- Friend connections exist, but they are still a lightweight connection list rather than a full friend-request system.
- X/Twitter and email are mostly placeholder-level in settings.
- NFTs exist in schema, contracts, admin routes, profile reads, and UI assets, but the real mint/verification lifecycle still needs validation.
- AI integration exists in the frontend, but it needs functional and security verification.
- The top banner and surrounding product copy needed to be simplified around the escrow marketplace story.
- Documentation is inconsistent with the actual code in several places.

## Recently completed

## Priority backlog

### P0 - Product copy and launch messaging cleanup

**Detailed AI Prompt**

```text
Task:
- Remove product-facing copy that still feels like a beta experiment or points users toward outdated flows.
- Keep the marketplace story centered on wallet auth, proposals, escrow funding, milestones, and trust.

Not the task:
- Do not redesign the marketplace flow itself.
- Do not add new product features while doing copy cleanup.

Technical scope:
- Audit navbar/banner copy, landing copy, dashboard copy, and launch-related markdown files.
- Remove stale dates, outdated launch claims, and copy that conflicts with the escrow-first marketplace narrative.
- Make sure the same positioning appears consistently across client UI and docs.

Acceptance criteria:
- The top-level product story is consistent everywhere a user first encounters the platform.
- There are no obvious stale launch/beta messages left in core user-facing surfaces.

Verification:
- Review the navbar, landing surfaces, and top-level docs side by side after the cleanup.
```

- [ ] Remove the network status banner from the navbar announcement bar.
- [ ] Remove outdated launch/beta copy and stale dates from the top announcement content.
- [ ] Update repo documentation so the product description matches the actual direction: escrow marketplace + admin/social/reputation.

### P0 - Remove deprecated payment directions

**Detailed AI Prompt**

```text
Task:
- Move token selection and realtime token value handling out of the job application flow and into the job posting flow.
- Make the client's token choice authoritative so freelancers apply against the token and funding asset already chosen for the job.
- Remove deprecated alternate payment concepts that conflict with the escrow marketplace.
- Make escrow funding and on-chain verification the only supported payment direction.

Not the task:
- Do not introduce token swaps, custodial flows, or new payment abstractions.
- Do not let freelancers override the payment token during proposal/application submission.
- Do not preserve dead code just because it might be useful later.

Technical scope:
- Audit backend, client, shared modules, docs, and planning files for alternate-payment references and token-conversion-style UI.
- Move the token selection/realtime token value logic to the job posting/create-project flow so the client selects the payment asset before proposals are submitted.
- Update job creation, proposal submission, proposal review, and escrow activation data flow so the selected token originates from the job/project itself.
- Restrict freelancer applications so they inherit the token selected by the client instead of choosing or converting tokens at application time.
- Remove unused code paths, stale type branches, and docs that imply multiple competing payment models.
- Keep the minimum migration-safe compatibility only if something is still actively referenced.

Acceptance criteria:
- Clients choose the token during job posting/project creation.
- Freelancers can see the selected token when applying but cannot change it.
- Escrow funding and downstream contract verification use the token selected on the job/project.
- There is one canonical payment direction in code and docs.
- Deprecated alternate-payment paths are removed or clearly archived.

Verification:
- Search the repo for old payment terminology and application-time token conversion references and confirm only intentional references remain.
- Test job posting, proposal submission, proposal acceptance, and escrow funding to confirm the same client-selected token is used end to end.
```

- [ ] Move realtime token value selection/display from the job application flow to the job posting/project creation flow.
- [ ] Make the client-selected token the authoritative payment token stored on the job/project.
- [ ] Update freelancer application/proposal UX so the selected token is visible but not editable by the freelancer.
- [ ] Ensure proposal review and escrow activation consume the token selected during job posting.
- [ ] Remove legacy alternate-payment references from docs and planning files.
- [ ] Remove unused deprecated payment code paths from backend, client, and shared modules.
- [ ] Replace the legacy alternate-payment markdown with a neutral archival note or remove it.

### P0 - Canonical proposal activation flow

**Detailed AI Prompt**

```text
Task:
- Make the proposal acceptance path explicit and singular: client accepts proposal, escrow transaction is verified, project becomes active.
- Remove ambiguous progress states or legacy UI that suggests alternate activation routes.

Not the task:
- Do not redesign proposal UX beyond what is needed for correctness and clarity.
- Do not add new status models unless required to simplify and align the current flow.

Technical scope:
- Audit proposal acceptance UI, backend verification flow, project activation state updates, and related docs.
- Remove obsolete progress tracking if it no longer reflects the real activation model.
- Update labels, helper text, and docs to point to the escrow verification path as the source of truth.

Acceptance criteria:
- Proposal acceptance has one authoritative activation path.
- Project state changes and docs match the verified escrow flow.

Verification:
- Walk through a proposal acceptance scenario from client action to active project state and verify every surface matches the same sequence.
```

- [ ] Remove obsolete proposal acceptance progress tracking if it is no longer part of the intended flow.
- [ ] Reconfirm the single canonical proposal acceptance flow: client accepts proposal, escrow tx is verified, project becomes active.

**Detailed AI Prompt**

```text
Task:
- Turn the remaining backlog into execution-ready feature slices instead of broad umbrella asks.

4. Verify AI integration and decide client-side vs server-side strategy.
5. Build real X/email connection flows.
6. Upgrade connections into a proper friend request system.
7. Expand notifications/messaging to support the new relationship and identity events.
8. Reconcile and validate NFT/reputation flows.
9. Add the referral system.
10. Revisit the social/profile layer once trust signals and identity features are real.
